 I wrote solidity code for a simple Dapp: a factory contract that create other contracts to register (name, surname, etc). 
 I used constructor with name, surname, etc, but in solidity 0.5.0 doesn't work.
So I used a similar logic code when we want to create new token, but there is some problem. can you help me?
